Simple Sinatra
==============

Simple Sinatra is a simple, ready-to-go setup for Sinatra. It includes such
fabulous things as...

  - i18n Support!
  - Gemfiles!
  - Helpers!
  - Files!

With such supercalifragilisticexpialidocious things like these, who needs
anything else?!

Installation
============

Not much to say here...

    $ git clone git://github.com/dunsmoreb/simple-sinatra.git

Then you'll want to create the relevant asset directories required by the
shorthand asset methods.

    $ mkdir public/css public/img public/js

And finally we need to create the relevant directories required by
`sinatra-sequel`.

    $ mkdir -p db/migrations

And then you'll probably want to delete this README.

    $ rm README.md

You can contact me through email and nothing else. At all. Thanks for using
